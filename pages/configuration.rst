Text's Max Length option in Layout tab gives you ability to set how long the text of Text, Textarea and Link extra field type is display in item list. If the text is longer than the length you set, it will be truncated, 3 dots are appended to the end. This prevents long texts from breaking your item list when they are displayed in full.
