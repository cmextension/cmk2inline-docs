You can update CM K2 Inline with Joomla!'s Extension Manager, the same way you update other Joomla! extensions.

After you update, you should go to Template override section in CM K2 Inline to click "Create override layout file" to update the override layout file in your template's override folder. This makes sure you have the latest code, otherwise there would be errors.
