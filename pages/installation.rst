Installation
============

Installation is easy, just like installing any other Joomla! extension. You just need to use the available tools in Extension Manager to install (Top menu -> Extensions -> Extension Manager).

Using "Upload & Install" tool to upload the ZIP package of CM K2 Inline to install is the easiest and fastest way.
